## Instructor Facilitation Guide

### [0-10 min] The 6 AI-DORA Metrics

> **Instructor Note:** Put the metric table on the projector and leave it up for the entire module. Participants will reference it repeatedly.

PRISM extends the standard 4 DORA metrics with 2 AI-specific metrics, giving you 6 total:

| # | Metric | What It Measures | Source |
|---|--------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | **Deployment Frequency** | How often you ship to production | CI/CD pipeline events |
| 2 | **Lead Time for Changes** | Time from commit to production | Git timestamps + deploy timestamps |
| 3 | **Change Failure Rate** | % of deployments causing incidents | Incident system + deploy events |
| 4 | **Mean Time to Recovery** | How fast you recover from failures | Incident open/close timestamps |
| 5 | **AI Contribution Ratio** | % of commits/PRs with AI involvement | Git trailer `AI-Origin` |
| 6 | **AI Acceptance Rate** | % of AI-generated code that passes review/eval | PR reviews + eval gate results |

**Key talking points:**

1. Metrics 1-4 are standard DORA. If you already track these, PRISM enhances them with AI context (e.g., "deployment frequency *of AI-assisted changes* vs. human-only").

2. Metric 5 (AI Contribution Ratio) answers: "How much of our velocity comes from AI?" This is what your CTO wants to show the board.

3. Metric 6 (AI Acceptance Rate) answers: "Is our AI output actually good, or are we generating code that gets reverted?" A team with 80% AI contribution but 30% acceptance rate has a garbage problem, not a velocity gain.

4. All 6 metrics start with **data captured at commit time**. That's why the git hooks we're about to install are the foundation of everything.

### [10-15 min] How Metadata Flows

Draw the data flow on the whiteboard:

```
Developer Machine              GitHub                 AWS
┌──────────────────┐   ┌────────────────┐   ┌────────────────────────┐

└──────────────────┘   │ EventBridge    │   │        │               │
                        └────────────────┘   │        v               │
                                              │ CloudWatch Dashboard  │
                                              │ QuickSight Dashboard  │
                                              └────────────────────────┘
```

Explain each stage:
1. **prepare-commit-msg hook** -- Runs before the commit message editor opens. Detects if Claude Code was the author and automatically adds AI-Origin, AI-Model, and AI-Confidence trailers.
2. **post-commit hook** -- Runs after commit. Logs the commit metadata to a local file (useful for offline work).
3. **GitHub Actions workflow step** -- On push/merge, extracts trailers from all new commits and emits structured events to Amazon EventBridge.
4. **EventBridge rule** -- Routes `ai-metric` events to Timestream for storage.
5. **Dashboards** -- CloudWatch and QuickSight query Timestream and render the 6 metrics.

> **Instructor Note:** Participants will install steps 1-3 today. Steps 4-5 are pre-deployed in the workshop AWS account (or covered in Module 05's CDK deploy).

### [15-25 min] Exercise 1: Install PRISM Git Hooks

Direct participants to `exercises/01-install-hooks.md`.

They will:
1. Copy the hook scripts into their sample-app `.git/hooks/` directory
2. Make a test commit and verify the trailers are auto-added
3. Understand the detection logic

> **Instructor Note:** The most common issue is file permissions. The hook scripts must be executable (`chmod +x`). If a participant's commit goes through without trailers, check permissions first.

---

### [25-35 min] Exercise 2: Make 3 Types of Commits

Direct participants to `exercises/02-three-commits.md`.

They will:
1. Make a **human-only** commit (edit a file manually, commit manually)
2. Make an **AI-assisted** commit (use Claude Code to help, but human edits too)
3. Make an **AI-generated** commit (Claude Code does everything)
4. Verify that each commit has the correct AI-Origin trailer

This exercise generates the test data they'll need for Module 05's dashboards.

---

### [35-42 min] Exercise 3: Configure GitHub Actions Metric Emission

Direct participants to `exercises/03-github-actions-metrics.md`.

They will:
1. Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs on push to main
2. The workflow extracts trailers from new commits
3. Emits metric events to EventBridge via AWS CLI

> **Instructor Note:** If participants don't have push access to a GitHub repo, they can review the workflow YAML and do a dry-run locally. The important thing is understanding the extraction and emission pattern, not the CI platform specifics.

---

### [42-45 min] Wrap-Up

**Check for understanding:**
- "What's the difference between the prepare-commit-msg hook and the post-commit hook?"
- "Why do we emit metrics from CI rather than from the developer's machine?"
- "What happens if a developer uninstalls the git hooks?"

**Answer to the third question:** The CI workflow is the source of truth, not the local hooks. Local hooks are a convenience that gives developers immediate feedback. The CI workflow runs on every push regardless and extracts trailers if present. If a developer removes their hooks, commits won't have trailers, and the CI workflow will log those as `AI-Origin: unknown`. This shows up on the dashboard as a data quality issue that the team lead can address.

**Bridge to Module 04:** You now have metrics flowing from commits through CI. But we're only measuring quantity -- how much AI involvement. In Module 04, we add quality gates: is the AI-generated code actually correct?

## Common Questions

**Q: Do the git hooks slow down commits?**
A: The prepare-commit-msg hook runs in <100ms (it's checking environment variables, not calling an API). The post-commit hook appends to a local log file. Neither adds perceptible delay.

**Q: What if we use GitLab or Bitbucket instead of GitHub?**
A: The git hooks are platform-agnostic. The CI metric emission step is GitHub Actions-specific in the workshop, but the same `aws events put-events` command works in any CI system. We have examples for GitLab CI and Bitbucket Pipelines in the PRISM docs.

**Q: Can a developer fake the AI-Origin trailer?**
A: Yes. Local git trailers are not cryptographically signed. The hooks add them automatically based on detection heuristics, but a developer could manually edit them. This is by design -- the system measures contribution patterns, not enforces them. If someone is gaming the metrics, that's a management conversation, not a technical control.
