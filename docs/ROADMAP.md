## How This Roadmap Works

Items are organized into **phases** based on impact and dependency order. Each item includes:
- **Priority:** P0 (critical gap), P1 (high value), P2 (nice to have)
- **Complexity:** S (small, 1-2 days), M (medium, 3-5 days), L (large, 1-2 weeks), XL (epic, 2+ weeks)
- **Labels:** `dashboard`, `pipeline`, `infra`, `docs`, `new-metric`, `integration`, `community`
- **Closes gap vs:** Which 3P tools this catches up to or surpasses

Contributors: pick any item, open an issue referencing the roadmap ID (e.g., `R-101`), and submit a PR. See [Contributing](#contributing) at the bottom.

## Phase 1 — Close Critical Dashboard Gaps

*Goal: Make both dashboard tiers complete so executives and developers see the full picture.*

| ID | Item | Priority | Complexity | Labels | Closes Gap vs |
|----|------|----------|------------|--------|---------------|

## Phase 2B — Token Usage & Cost Intelligence (Bedrock)

*Goal: Capture Bedrock token consumption from Claude Code, Kiro, and Q Developer. Correlate to developers, commits, PRs, and features. Overlay cost. See [Data Architecture](./data-architecture.md) for the full gap analysis.*

| ID | Item | Priority | Complexity | Labels | Details |

| **R-216** | **Developer session analytics** — Group Bedrock API calls into sessions (gap > 15 min = new session). Track: duration, turns, tokens in/out, models used, cost. New `prism.d1.session` event type. | P1 | L | `pipeline`, `new-metric` | Enables "avg session cost", "tokens per session", "sessions per developer per day". |
| **R-217** | ✅ **Done** — **CloudWatch token & cost metrics** — Published: `BedrockTokensInput`, `BedrockTokensOutput`, `BedrockCostUSD`, `CostPerCommit`, `TokenEfficiency`. Dims: TeamId, Developer, Model. CostPerPR/CostPerSession pending. | P0 | M | `pipeline`, `new-metric` | Core metric publication for downstream dashboards. |
| **R-218** | ✅ **Done** — **Token & cost dashboards** — Added Cost Intelligence section to both dashboards: daily token trends, cost by model, cost-per-commit, Bedrock cost, token efficiency. | P0 | L | `dashboard` | Exec: weekly cost + cost/deploy. Dev: daily trends + efficiency. |
| **R-219** | ✅ **Done** — **Cost anomaly alarms** — `BedrockDailyCostHigh` (>$100/day) and `TokenEfficiencyLow` (>500 tokens/line). SNS not yet wired. | P1 | S | `infra`, `dashboard` | Prevents runaway costs. |
| **R-220** | **Multi-tool cost normalization** — Unified view across Bedrock (pay-per-token), Copilot (subscription), Cursor (subscription + usage). Normalize to cost-per-developer-day. | P2 | M | `pipeline`, `dashboard` | Different pricing models make comparison hard. |
| **R-221** | **ROI calculator with token cost input** — Enhanced ROI Multiplier: `(time_saved × hourly_eng_cost) / (token_cost + license_cost)`. Show break-even and marginal ROI. | P1 | M | `dashboard`, `new-metric` | The "is AI worth it?" answer for CFOs. |
