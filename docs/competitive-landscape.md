# PRISM D1 Velocity — Competitive Landscape & Gap Analysis

> **Last updated:** 2026-04-22
> **Purpose:** Compare PRISM D1's AI-DORA metrics against leading 3P engineering intelligence platforms to identify differentiators, gaps, and roadmap priorities.

---

## Executive Summary

PRISM D1 Velocity introduces **AI-native DORA extensions** that no commercial platform currently offers — eval gate pass rates, spec-to-code velocity, AI provenance tracking, and AI-vs-human defect comparison. However, established platforms lead in developer experience measurement, industry benchmarking, cost/license analytics, and cross-org rollups.

This document maps the landscape, identifies where PRISM leads and trails, and feeds the [community roadmap](./ROADMAP.md).

## Platforms Compared

| Platform | Focus | Pricing Tier | AI Metric Maturity |
|----------|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Swarmia** | Team productivity + DORA | Mid-market | Moderate — adoption & cycle time |
| **Jellyfish** | Executive engineering intelligence | Enterprise ($50K+/yr) | Strong — 10+ AI tools, ROI |
| **LinearB** | DORA + workflow automation | Mid-market (free DORA tier) | Moderate — Copilot/Cursor focus |

## Internal Dashboard Gap Analysis

PRISM D1 ships two dashboard tiers — an Executive Readout and a Team Velocity (developer) dashboard. The table below highlights where signals are missing at each tier:

| Signal | Executive Readout | Team Velocity | Gap |
|--------|:-----------------:|:-------------:|-----|
| DORA metrics | Single-value summaries | Time-series with thresholds | Exec lacks trend drill-down |
| AI Acceptance Rate | 90-day trend | Time-series with L2/L3 targets | Well-covered |
| Cost / Budget | ROI Multiplier (no cost input) | Not shown | Neither has real cost data |
| Team Comparison | Multi-team overlay | Single team | Devs can't compare across teams |
| Defect Quality (AI vs Human) | **Not shown** | Side-by-side | Exec has no quality visibility |
| Spec-to-Code Hours | **Not shown** | Time-series | Exec missing velocity signal |
| AI Test Coverage Delta | **Not shown** | Time-series | Exec missing quality signal |
| PRISM Level | Gauge + radar | **Not shown** | Devs can't see their maturity |
| Incidents / Alerts | **Not shown** | **Not shown** | Neither surfaces incident data |

**Key finding:** Quality signals (defects, test coverage) don't bubble up to executives. Maturity context (PRISM level, team comparison) doesn't flow down to developers. Neither tier surfaces incidents.

## Competitive Positioning

### Where PRISM D1 Wins

1. **AI Quality Gates** — Only platform with eval-gate-pass-rate as a first-class metric. This directly addresses the "AI code ships fast but breaks things" concern that Faros AI's research highlighted (242.7% increase in incidents per AI-generated PR in some orgs).

2. **Spec-Driven Lifecycle Tracking** — No 3P tool measures the spec-to-code pipeline. This is unique to the PRISM framework's spec-first development philosophy.

3. **AI Provenance at Event Level** — While Jellyfish and DX track AI code percentages, PRISM tags every individual event with its AI origin, enabling granular attribution.

4. **Maturity Model** — The PRISM L1-L5 framework provides a structured adoption path. Commercial tools show metrics but don't prescribe a maturity journey.

5. **AWS-Native / Zero 3P Cost** — Runs entirely on CloudWatch, QuickSight, EventBridge, and DynamoDB. No per-seat licensing fees.

6. **MCP Tool Governance** — Only platform with scope-based authorization, session management, and audit logging for MCP tool calls. No 3P tool governs agent-to-tool access.

7. **Bedrock Guardrail Integration** — Only platform with deployed Bedrock Guardrails (content filters, PII protection, denied topics) and per-trigger metric tracking. No 3P tool enforces AI safety at the platform level.

8. **AI vs Human Defect Comparison** — Only platform correlating deployment failures to AI vs human commit origins, providing side-by-side defect rates.

### Where PRISM D1 Trails

1. **Developer Experience** — No qualitative/survey capability. DX and Faros combine systems data with developer sentiment for a complete picture.

2. **Benchmarking** — No industry comparison data. LinearB has 8.1M+ PRs of benchmark data; Jellyfish and DX offer peer comparisons.

3. ~~**Cost Intelligence**~~ — **CLOSED.** Token-level cost tracking via CloudTrail → Bedrock pipeline now provides per-developer, per-model, per-commit cost attribution. Remaining gap: multi-tool cost normalization (Copilot/Cursor subscription models).

4. **Scale & Rollups** — Dashboards are per-team. No org-wide hierarchy, drill-down, or cross-team aggregation at the executive level.

5. **Self-Serve Analytics** — No natural-language query interface. Jellyfish, DX, and Faros all offer AI copilots for exploring metrics data.

## Key Industry Data Points

- **Faros AI (2025 DORA Report):** AI-generated PRs show 441% increase in review wait time and 242.7% increase in incidents per PR — making eval gates and defect tracking critical.
- **LinearB (2026 Benchmarks):** AI PRs have 32.7% merge acceptance rate vs. 84.4% for manual PRs — acceptance rate tracking is essential.
- **DX Research:** Developer satisfaction with AI tools correlates more strongly with productivity gains than raw usage metrics — surveys matter.
- **Jellyfish:** Organizations using 3+ AI coding tools see diminishing returns without centralized measurement — multi-tool tracking is table stakes.
