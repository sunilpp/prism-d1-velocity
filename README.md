# PRISM D1: Velocity — AI Development Lifecycle Workshop

> :warning: **Sample Project — Not Production-Ready**
>
> This project is provided as a sample and reference implementation only. It is not designed, tested, or hardened for production use. Use it as a starting point or learning resource, and perform your own security review, testing, and operational hardening before deploying to any production environment.

> Compress the idea-to-production loop with disciplined AI adoption.

Part of the [PRISM Framework](../README.md) (Progressive Readiness Index for Scalable Maturity) — the D1 Velocity pillar focuses on AI-native software development lifecycle practices that are **measurable from Day 1**.

## What This Repo Contains

### For Engineering Leaders (Top-Down Visibility)

- **AWS-native dashboards** comparable to Jellyfish/Swarmia — but built on CloudWatch + QuickSight
- **Enhanced DORA metrics** with AI-specific dimensions (acceptance rate, AI-to-merge ratio, eval gate pass rate)
- **Executive readout templates** that connect engineering metrics to business outcomes
- **PRISM level tracking** — see your org's maturity score change over time

### For Engineering Teams (Bottom-Up Activation)

- **4-hour workshop** (+ extensions) with hands-on exercises using Claude Code + Bedrock
- **Spec-driven development** templates compatible with Kiro
- **AI agent development** — build agents with Strands SDK, MCP, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
- **Bootstrapper code** — git hooks, CI workflows, eval harnesses, agent configs teams inherit permanently
- **Sample application** with task API + MCP server + Strands agent to practice AI-DLC patterns

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Run the setup script to install and verify everything automatically:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

Or install manually:

- AWS Account with Bedrock access (Claude models enabled)
- Node.js 20+ and npm
- Python 3.11+ (for Strands Agent)
- AWS CLI v2 and CDK v2 (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)
- Claude Code CLI configured for Bedrock (`export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1`)
- Git 2.40+, jq, GitHub CLI

The setup script supports flags:
- `--skip-aws` — skip AWS credential and Bedrock checks (for offline prep)
- `--skip-kiro` — skip Kiro IDE check
- `--verify-only` — only verify, don't install anything

### Deploy the Metrics Platform

```bash
cd infra
npm install
npx cdk bootstrap   # First time only
npx cdk deploy --all
```

### Assess a Customer

Run the [PRISM Assessment](assessment/README.md) to determine maturity level and onboarding track. See the [full methodology guide](assessment/ASSESSMENT-GUIDE.md) for scanner logic, interview rubrics, and scoring formulas.

### Run the Workshop

Start with [Module 00: Prerequisites](workshop/00-prerequisites/README.md) and work through sequentially.

### Run the Sample Agent (No AWS Required)

```bash
cd sample-app
npm install && npm run dev          # Start the task API

cd agent
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python scripts/run-demo.py --mock   # Run agent demo with mock model
```

### Adopt the Bootstrapper (Post-Workshop)

```bash
# Copy into your project
cp -r bootstrapper/ ~/your-repo/.prism/
cd ~/your-repo

# Install hooks and workflows
.prism/metric-hooks/install.sh
cp .prism/github-workflows/*.yml .github/workflows/
cp .prism/claude-code/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md

# For agent projects, also copy:
cp .prism/agent-configs/ ./agent-configs/
cp .prism/claude-code/CLAUDE-agent.md ./CLAUDE-agent.md

# Configure your team ID
echo 'PRISM_TEAM_ID=your-team-name' >> .env
```
