# PRISM D1: Velocity — AI Development Lifecycle Workshop

> :warning: **Sample Project — Not Production-Ready**
>
> This project is provided as a sample and reference implementation only. It is not designed, tested, or hardened for production use. Use it as a starting point or learning resource, and perform your own security review, testing, and operational hardening before deploying to any production environment.

> Compress the idea-to-production loop with disciplined AI adoption.

Part of the [PRISM Framework](../README.md) (Progressive Readiness Index for Scalable Maturity) — the D1 Velocity pillar focuses on AI-native software development lifecycle practices that are **measurable from Day 1**.

### For Security Leaders (Governance & Compliance)

- **Bedrock Guardrails** — content filters, PII protection, denied topics with per-trigger metrics
- **MCP Authorization** — scope-based tool access control with audit trail
- **Eval Gates** — 5 rubrics (code-quality, API, security, agent, spec-compliance) + SECURITY-09 (Security Agent findings)
- **KMS encryption** on all data stores, VPC isolation, exfiltration detection
- **12 CloudWatch alarms** including security critical finding, pen test exploit, remediation SLA

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

Or install manually: AWS Account with Bedrock access, Node.js 20+, Python 3.11+, AWS CLI v2, CDK v2, Claude Code CLI, Git 2.40+, jq, GitHub CLI.

### Deploy the Metrics Platform

```bash
cd infra
npm install
npx cdk bootstrap   # First time only
npx cdk deploy --all
```

This deploys: EventBridge bus, 8 Lambda processors, DynamoDB tables (KMS-encrypted), 5 CloudWatch dashboards, 12 alarms, Bedrock Guardrails, model pricing table, identity mapping table.

> **For cost tracking:** Enable CloudTrail data events for Bedrock after deploying. See [Bootstrapper Step 6](bootstrapper/README.md#step-6-enable-cloudtrail-for-bedrock-required-for-cost-tracking). Without this, the Cost Intelligence dashboard sections will be empty.

> **For Security Agent:** Add `--context enableSecurityAgent=true` if Security Agent is enabled in your account. See the [Security Agent Setup Guide](bootstrapper/security-agent/SETUP-GUIDE.md).

### Assess a Customer

Run the [PRISM Assessment](assessment/README.md) to determine maturity level and onboarding track. See the [full methodology guide](assessment/ASSESSMENT-GUIDE.md) for scanner logic, interview rubrics, and scoring formulas.

### Run the Workshop

Start with [Module 00: Prerequisites](workshop/00-prerequisites/README.md) and work through sequentially.

### Run the Sample Agent (No AWS Required)

```bash
cd sample-app
npm install && npm run dev          # Start the task API

cd agent
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python scripts/run-demo.py --mock   # Run agent demo with mock model
```

### Adopt the Bootstrapper (Post-Workshop)

```bash
cp -r bootstrapper/ ~/your-repo/.prism/
cd ~/your-repo

# Install hooks and workflows
.prism/metric-hooks/install.sh
cp .prism/github-workflows/*.yml .github/workflows/
cp .prism/claude-code/CLAUDE.md ./CLAUDE.md

# For agent projects:
cp .prism/agent-configs/ ./agent-configs/
cp .prism/claude-code/CLAUDE-agent.md ./CLAUDE-agent.md

# For Security Agent:
.prism/security-agent/setup.sh --api-url <url> --api-key <key> --team-id <team>

# Configure your team ID
echo 'PRISM_TEAM_ID=your-team-name' >> .env
```
